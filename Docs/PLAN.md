# The plan

Written after opening the shipped `.usdz` files with Pixar's USD library rather
than guessing from screenshots, revised after the first session in which Meshy
could be driven from this environment, and again after the session in which
its files could finally be fetched and both new families were built and
painted. The measurements below are from the actual files and they change the
answer to "can this look like Summoners War".

---

## What the files actually say

```
anubis.usdz     upAxis Z    197,879 triangles    98,947 vertices
                24-joint humanoid rig (Hips/LeftUpLeg/… — Mixamo naming)
                skin weights present, 10 influences per vertex
                155 frames of animation at 30fps
                bounding box 212 × 212 × 320 units, metersPerUnit = 1.0
                origin ~1/3 up the torso, ~100 units off centre
```

Two findings matter.

**The render bug was scale, not orientation.** The game asks for a 2.05 m
character; the file describes a 320 m one standing 100 m off the origin. A
camera framing two metres of world therefore showed an arbitrary slice of the
model's shin. No amount of rotating it could have fixed that, which is why two
attempts at orientation did not. `ModelOrientation.normalise` now measures the
model and scales, centres and grounds it.

**Every animation clip is real.** 46 to 155 frames each. The motion was always
there; nothing could play it at that scale.

## What the second look found

The first build with those files loaded Anubis as a scatter of gold shards. The
files were re-read with USD and skinned in numpy, and five things were wrong
with the export, none of them with the game:

1. The armature's centimetre-to-metre scale existed only as a time sample, with
   no default value, so at rest the file described a 170-unit figure.
2. The skeleton's rest pose was not its bind pose: the hips sat 68 units to
   one side and twisted 40°, so the un-animated model — what the summon stage
   shows — stood somewhere else.
3. The mesh was Y-up data tilted 90° by its own node inside a Z-up stage, with
   the same tilt repeated in `geomBindTransform`.
4. Every vertex carried ten bone influences, padded from a mean of three.
   Model I/O's skinning attributes are four wide; a reader that assumes four
   mis-strides the array and glues vertices to random bones, which is what
   shards are.
5. The clips carried horizontal root motion — the combat idle started 49 cm off
   the slot — and floated 5–13 cm above the ground.

Reading the clips frame by frame turned up two more: the hit reaction was a
knock-up with no flinch in it (airborne by frame three, on his back by frame
twenty-one), and the attacks ran 2.5–3.9 s against the second or so the engine
allows a hit. The tool now synthesises a flinch from the combat idle when the
exported reaction is a fall, and the game plays one-shot clips at the contract's
pace.

So the pipeline now writes a **canonical** file (`tools/character.py`): Y-up,
metres, feet on the origin, facing +Z, rest = bind, four influences, root
locked and grounded, every prim named once. The loader was given a matching
belt-and-braces step — a cloned skinner is rebound to its own bones — and it
logs the bounding box and skinner it actually built, so the next console paste
settles what SceneKit does with a clean file.

## What the third look found: Meshy's GLB

The first Meshy file through the pipeline verified at **190 metres tall** in
every animated frame. The verify step exists for exactly this, and it caught it
before the phone did. The cause was a convention, not a corruption:

1. Meshy's rigged GLB (a Blender export) parents the mesh to an `Armature`
   node scaled 0.01 — the joints are in centimetres — while the vertices are
   already in metres. glTF says a skinned mesh node's own transform is
   ignored, so which frame the vertices were authored in is the exporter's
   choice: the world for Blender, the mesh node's frame for the older Khronos
   samples, an ancestor's for `RiggedSimple`. The reader assumed the mesh
   node's frame, read a 2 cm figure, and scaled the skeleton by a hundred to
   compensate. It now recovers the frame from the joints themselves (inverse
   bind × rest world is one matrix, the same for every joint when rest equals
   bind) and only falls back to assuming when they disagree. Verified on all
   five Khronos rigs, which between them use three conventions, and on both
   families.
2. The material wires the **base colour into emission at full strength**. The
   game deliberately keeps an export's emissive map (glowing runes are
   authored), so shipped as-is both characters would have rendered self-lit
   and flat. An emissive that is the base colour image is dropped.
3. Meshy's "Hit Reaction" clip is a real flinch — hips sink 8 cm, the head
   rocks 10 cm, feet stay planted, the pose recovers — so it ships as
   exported. Anubis's remains the synthesised one.

## Polygons: the actual comparison

| | triangles |
|---|---|
| Summoners War monster (2014, mobile) | ~2,000–5,000 |
| The raw Anubis export | 197,879 |
| **What ships now** | **4,999**, plus a 1,499 `_lod` for crowded stages |

Decimation, run for real over the whole family with `python3 tools/mesh.py anubis`:

```
anubis.usdz              197,879 → 4,999 tris    22.0 → 1.6 MB   1024 texture
anubis_lod.usdz          197,879 → 1,499 tris    22.0 → 0.5 MB    512 texture
anubis_<clip>.usdz  × 6  197,879 → 1,499 tris    21.9 → 0.1–0.2 MB each, 128 texture
                                                153.5 → 3.0 MB in the app bundle, 9 s
```

And over the two Meshy families, which arrive lighter (Meshy remeshes to the
requested 30,000 quads):

```
sekhmet.usdz              56,281 → 5,000 tris    6.8 → 1.7 MB   1024 texture
sekhmet_lod.usdz          56,281 → 1,589 tris    6.8 → 0.5 MB    512 texture
sekhmet_<clip>.usdz × 6   56,281 → 1,589 tris    6.9 → 0.2–0.3 MB each, 128 texture
                                                48.3 → 3.5 MB in the app bundle
zeus.usdz                 55,839 → 5,000 tris    7.2 → 1.8 MB   1024 texture
zeus_lod.usdz             55,839 → 1,980 tris    7.2 → 0.5 MB    512 texture
zeus_<clip>.usdz × 6      55,839 → 1,980 tris    7.3 → 0.2–0.3 MB each, 128 texture
                                                51.1 → 3.8 MB in the app bundle
```

Sekhmet verifies at 2.001 m, Zeus at 2.146 m against 2.15 (the decimator
shaves the crown), both with feet at y = 0, facing +Z, four influences, rest
equal to bind to 1e-15, and every animated frame life-size.

Skin weights carry across by nearest-neighbour remapping from the source
vertices, and every output was re-read with USD afterwards: 24 joints, every
animation frame, weights renormalised, UVs and material binding intact. The
per-clip files are cut harder because `ModelLibrary` only lifts the animation
out of them; their geometry is read once and discarded.

The untouched exports now live in `Art/Models/`, outside the folder Xcode
synchronises into the app. Moving them cost the repository nothing — same
blobs — and the bundle 151 MB.

---

## Recommendation: stay on iOS/SceneKit

This reverses what I said earlier, and the reason is the measurements above.

The case for Unity was its tooling — a scene editor, an asset pipeline, a way to
handle models without a DCC package. But the model pipeline turns out to be
scriptable end to end: generating, rigging, animating, converting, normalising,
decimating and re-exporting all work from Python. That was the main thing the
move was buying.

What remains true about Unity: better particle and animation tooling, and an
asset store with rigged monster packs. Worth revisiting **at around ten
characters**, if authoring becomes the bottleneck. Not worth weeks of rewrite
today against a game that already runs on the phone.

The island is the one thing that argued for a scene editor, and it does not need
one — see phase 3.

---

## The character pipeline, end to end

`api.meshy.ai` is reachable from this environment and a `MESHY_API_KEY` is
provisioned, which removes the one step the previous plan said needed a person
at a keyboard. Four commands take a character from a sentence to the bundle:

```bash
python3 tools/meshy.py generate sekhmet --height 2.0 --prompt "..." --negative "..."
python3 tools/meshy.py download sekhmet      # -> Art/Models/sekhmet*.glb
python3 tools/mesh.py sekhmet                # -> Pantheon/Resources/Models/, canonical and decimated
```

`generate` runs text-to-3D preview, refine, rigging and one animation task per
clip, and records every task id in `Art/Models/<asset>.meshy.json` before it
waits, so a re-run resumes rather than paying again. Measured on Sekhmet:

| Stage | Credits | Wall clock | Output formats |
|---|---|---|---|
| preview | 20 | ~1.5 min | glb fbx obj stl **usdz** |
| refine (textures, PBR) | 10 | ~1.5 min | the above + base colour, metallic, roughness, normal maps |
| rig at 2.0 m | 5 | ~3 min | glb fbx only |
| six battle clips | 3 each | ~2 min, in parallel | glb fbx only |
| **one character** | **53** | **~12 min** | |

Only the unrigged stages return USDZ; `mesh.py` reads the GLB directly and
writes the canonical file described above, verified on three Khronos sample
rigs and on the whole Anubis family by re-skinning the written files in numpy.

The balance was 1,186 credits before Sekhmet, 1,133 after her and 1,080 after
Zeus: roughly twenty more characters at this rate.

**Nothing is closed any more.** `assets.meshy.ai` and `cdn.meshy.ai` are on the
allow-list; `download` fetched all fourteen files (seven per family, 7 MB
each) in under a minute, and the untouched exports are committed in
`Art/Models/` beside the manifests, the same way the Anubis sources are.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — make the current build correct *(in progress)*

- [x] Cut-out sprites for enemies, correct scale and aspect
- [x] Mirror floor reflection removed
- [x] Painted panel no longer swamps small plates
- [x] Model scale/centre/orientation normalised from measured bounds
- [x] Decimated models in the bundle (above)
- [x] Battle camera solved for a portrait phone: both lines in the clear band,
  a finite stage that fades into the painting, the painting cropped to the
  screen rather than stretched over it
- [x] Portraits, the summon stage, the island, an app icon; the gacha only
  produces characters whose art has shipped
- [ ] **Confirm on device.** Needs the `[ModelLibrary]` console block. The
  bundle now holds 24 model files, eight per family; nothing in it has been
  seen on a phone since the canonical rewrite, and Sekhmet and Zeus have
  never been seen at all.

### Phase 1 — the model pipeline *(done)*

Run in anger and measured above. The pipeline is `Art/Models` → `mesh.py` →
`Pantheon/Resources/Models`, one command per family.

### Phase 2 — a second and third character family *(Sekhmet and Zeus: done, unseen on device)*

Per family: a kit, a balance pass, five portraits, one mesh through Meshy, and
the pipeline above.

- **Sekhmet** — Ember bruiser, the roster's first damage archetype. Every
  variant's Eye of Ra breaks defence; the claws Burn, Slow, Glance, weaken or
  make unrecoverable depending on the element. Natural 5★, which also fills
  the gacha's 5★ tier for the first time.
  - [x] Kit, five variants, in `UnitDatabase.swift`; in the summon pool
  - [x] Balance model updated; the duel against Anubis sits at 81–88% for her
  - [x] Model, rig and six clips generated (task ids in the manifest)
  - [x] Downloaded, converted, decimated, verified: 3.5 MB in the bundle
  - [x] Five portraits, one generation and four reference edits; in the gacha
- **Zeus** — Greek, the roster's control archetype and the first unit outside
  Egypt. Every variant's Thunderclap hits the enemy line and takes its turn
  away (stun, freeze, sleep, attack-bar knockback, provoke); the Keraunos
  ignores 40% of defence and hands the team a buff; the awakened passive
  pushes the team's attack bar at the start of battle. Natural 5★.
  - [x] Kit, five variants, in `UnitDatabase.swift`; in the summon pool behind
    the art gate, with an "Olympus Stirs" banner that appears with his portraits
  - [x] Balance model updated (stun and area-skill valuation added); he beats
    Anubis 66–82% and loses to Sekhmet, which is the intended shape
  - [x] Model, rig and six clips generated (task ids in `Art/Models/zeus.meshy.json`)
  - [x] Forked-lightning effects for all three skills (`VFXLibrary`), the sky
    flashes with them, and a synthesised thunder crack (`thunder.wav`)
  - [x] Downloaded, converted, decimated, verified: 3.8 MB in the bundle
  - [x] Five portraits and the "Olympus Stirs" banner, which the game now
    offers; all fifteen characters are in the summon pool
- **Thoth** — Radiance support, a cleanse and an attack-bar push, so the
  Egyptians have a second support. Next.

### Phase 3 — the island *(built; the painting is a stand-in)*

Summoners War's town is not a 3D scene the player navigates. It is a painted
backdrop with a fixed camera and tappable hotspots. That is what `IslandView`
is: the app now opens on it.

- [x] `Landmark` model — title, anchor in the painting, unlock level,
  destination, upgrade tiers — and five landmarks in `IslandDatabase`
- [x] Tap targets mapped through the painting's aspect-fill frame, a glow on
  anything actionable (energy, scrolls, arena attacks), a count badge, a tier
  mark, locked state with a shake
- [x] A 1536 × 2048 backdrop — painted procedurally by `tools/island.py` so
  the screen had a horizon while the key was missing
- [x] The real painting. Two Gemini calls, not one: a 3:4 generation spread
  the island across a width a phone crops to 62%, so the arena would have
  been cut in half. It was generated at 9:16 instead and the sea extended to
  3:4 with a reference edit that left the island in place (measured: the
  centre differs by 7/255 with its best alignment at zero shift). The five
  anchors in `IslandDatabase` were then measured off the painting; the
  numbers are in `Docs/ART_2D.md` §6.
- [ ] Upgrade states of the buildings: a second and third painting per tier

### Phase 4 — sound and feel

- **Music.** Two synthesised loops are in — an island loop of pads, a drone
  and a plucked melody in E Phrygian dominant, and a 96 BPM battle loop with
  a kick, a frame drum, a bass ostinato and chord stabs (`tools/music.py`).
  Stand-ins, but stand-ins that set a mood. Suno or Udio for the real ones:
  a battle loop, a town loop, a summon sting. ~$10 for a month.
- **Voice.** ElevenLabs, one summon line per character. Cheap and very genre.
- Retune `Juice.profile` once there is real animation to sync against.

### Phase 5 — content and ship

Arena rating curve, a second campaign chapter, daily energy, then TestFlight.

---

## What to do next

1. **Pull, build, run** and send the `[ModelLibrary]` block from the console
   (`Docs/PLAYTEST.md` §1 says what each line means) with screenshots of the
   island, the collection, an Olympus Stirs reveal and a battle with Sekhmet
   or Zeus on the team. Three families of canonical files are in the bundle
   and none has been seen since the rewrite; that paste decides whether the
   canonical file is enough or SceneKit's importer needs a further workaround.
2. **If Sekhmet or Zeus look wrong** on the phone, the first thing to check is
   the console's bbox line against the numbers in `Docs/PLAYTEST.md` §1: the
   file says 2.00 and 2.15 m with feet at zero, so a wrong figure on screen is
   the importer's doing and the paste will show where.
3. **Then Thoth**, the second Egyptian support, by the same four commands and
   the same two Gemini calls — an hour of wall clock, 53 credits, no new
   tooling — and a Greek campaign chapter so Zeus has somewhere to fight.

## What I can and cannot do

| | |
|---|---|
| 2D art at volume | ✅ 29 assets in ~40 min, proven — when a Gemini key is present |
| Sound effects | ✅ synthesised, in the repo |
| Read, normalise, decimate, re-export 3D | ✅ proven on the whole Anubis family |
| **Generate, rig and animate a 3D character** | ✅ **proven twice: Sekhmet and Zeus, 53 credits and ~12 minutes each** |
| Convert Meshy's rigged GLB to USDZ | ✅ proven on both families, after one real bug the verify step caught |
| Fetch the finished files | ✅ fourteen files in under a minute |
| Paint a family and an island | ✅ eleven portraits, a banner and the island in ~6 minutes of Gemini time |
| All code, logic, balance, integration | ✅ |
| Compile or see the running app | ❌ — the reason bugs still reach your phone |

The 3D bottleneck is gone in practice, not just in principle: a character is
four commands and two Gemini calls, about an hour end to end including the
waiting, and it arrives verified. The one thing this environment still cannot
do is look at the result, which is why the next step is yours.
